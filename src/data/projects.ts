        title: "Two-Body Decay Simulations",
        description: "Simulating the decay process of neutral pions (π⁰ → γγ) using Python. Generated synthetic data using a uniform dsitribution and applied two-body kinematic analysis in both rest and lab frames. Used these results to explore momentum conservation and relativistic invariance",

        title: "Collider Event Analysis – Estimating Neutrino Species",
        description: "Analyzed proton-proton collision data to estimate the number of neutrino species. Processed datasets using Python to reconstruct missing energy and mass distributions. Applied statistical techniques to fit energy spectra and infer the number of undetectable decay products based on conservation laws.",

        title: "Music Popularity Prediction from Spotify Audio Features",
        description: "Developed models to estimate the popularity of songs using over 2 million entries from the Spotify API. Applied data cleaning, clustering, and feature engineering to extract signals from audio features (e.g., tempo, loudness). Benchmarked models including AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks; achieved 86% recall on top-performing tracks. Integrated a pricing tool to estimate royalties based on the predicted popularity.",
