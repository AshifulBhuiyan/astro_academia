  title: "Fermi Liquid Theory",
  description: "Graduate-level presentation with an accompanying written exposition, developed for a condensed-matter physics course. The talk introduces Landau Fermi liquid theory with an emphasis on physical motivation, quasiparticles and adiabatic continuity, the Landau energy functional, and connections to experimentally observable quantities such as specific heat, susceptibility, and transport.",

{title: "Partition Numbers",
description:"Undergraduate-level presentation developed in my final year of study for an advanced combinatorics course. The talk introduces the theory of integer partitions, with emphasis on diagrammatic representations (Ferrers and Young diagrams), ordered versus unordered partitions, generating functions, Euler's pentagonal number theorem, classical results of Ramanujan, and later structural developments due to Ono.",
