[The reddit discussion link](https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioGrade12s/comments/1pkl5qz/a_hard_truth_about_grades_ai_and_firstyear/)

I wanted to share something I’ve been seeing consistently from highschoolers. This is primarily for students that rely on AI to do their work.

This isn’t a rant, and I am not blaming students. But take this as a dire dire warning.

There is a pattern I keep seeing, kids despite getting in high marks in their maths or physics, once they make it to calc 1 or physics 1. Suddenly, they don't know how to use the power rule, graph a polynomial or even know the cross product. 

Many of these kids end up dropping the course because they're going into the 40% exam with a 40% in the course, and probably have never solved a problem in the course on their own without AI assistance. 

## So what changed? It surely was not like this before.

Well clearly there is grade inflation taking place, we all know that medians went from 70% to 90s in some courses. AI tools are now making homework and assignments trivial to fake. Answers for questions on a test can just be memorized, rather than being tested on knowledge or thinking.

The result is that many students reach university without realizing they’re missing fundamentals.

Many University courses are weighted like this in first year now:
- assignments are worth 1% each.
- Exams cover 80% of the grade.
And yet...
**STUDENTS ARE CHEATING ON THE 1% ASSIGNMENTS**.

When a student does this, they might have gotten 100% on all assignments and gotten that sweet sweet 10%. But they're walking into a 40% midterm with no **REAL** practice and fail hard. Or have to drop the course because they are going into the final with a 40% mark with no hope of recovery, pretty much losing out on their time and money.

## What I want Grade 12 students to understand, specially those going into STEM.

1. Your average is not your safety net. 
2. Homework is supposed to be practice, the little percentage of mark you get or lose is of no consequence compared to the final, or more importantly your knowledge and understanding.
3. If you can’t do problems without AI, that gap will show up fast.
4. First-year math and physics exams are unforgiving.

I highly recommend NEVER asking LLMs to solve a (homework) problem in math or physics. 

They will be able to solve the problem, correctly even. But the cost? Your education.
