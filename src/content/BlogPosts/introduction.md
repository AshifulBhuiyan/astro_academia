Hello and welcome! My name is Ashiful Bhuiyan, and I’m excited to share my work, interests, and ongoing projects with you.

I’ve always been driven by a curiosity for how the universe works, especially through the lens of mathematics and physics. My academic background is rooted in **mathematical physics** and **applied mathematics**, and over the years I’ve built experience with **numerical modeling, simulation, and machine learning**—tools that allow us to dig deeper into the patterns and principles that underlie both physical systems and data.

Beyond theory, I’m passionate about education and outreach. As the co-founder and director of [Gifted Center](https://giftedcenter.org), I’ve helped support dozens of students in mathematics, physics, and science, designing programs that make complex topics accessible and relevant. I believe that with the right guidance and resources, anyone can excel in STEM fields.

### Exploring Heat Transfer and Fluid Dynamics

One of my major recent projects, **Natural Convection and Heat Transfer in Enclosures**, blends both analytical and computational skills. I developed a comprehensive Python toolkit to simulate two-dimensional natural convection in rectangular enclosures, addressing both clear fluids and porous media. This project numerically solves vorticity-streamfunction and energy equations under various boundary conditions and systematically investigates the effects of parameters like Rayleigh, Prandtl, and Darcy numbers. Analytical solutions are implemented and visualized alongside the numerical work, with all code and notebooks openly available for further research and engineering applications.

### Science, Climate, and AI for the Future

I am also deeply involved in [Ashiful.Institute](https://ashiful.institute), an initiative focused on climate advocacy and making high-quality AI education accessible worldwide. Through this work, I aim to bridge the gap between scientific understanding, technological innovation, and public action. Whether it’s supporting climate awareness, developing AI-driven tools for research, or mentoring the next generation of learners, I believe in leveraging knowledge for meaningful, positive impact.

On this site, you’ll find a mix of my research projects, simulations, and open-source tools. Whether it’s analyzing particle decay events, predicting music popularity with machine learning, or creating teaching resources, my goal is to connect rigorous analysis with real-world applications.

I’m especially interested in the intersection of physics, data science, and modern computational techniques—from **simulating physical processes** to **fine-tuning generative AI models** for creative and analytical purposes. I enjoy collaborating on exploratory projects, and I welcome connections from others with similar interests.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore my portfolio, reach out for collaboration, or just say hello.
